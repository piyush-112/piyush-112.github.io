          Hi, I’m <strong>Piyush Chaudhari</strong> — a passionate{" "}
          <strong>Software Developer</strong> who loves building practical and impactful 
          tech solutions. I enjoy turning ideas into powerful applications using 
          Java, Spring Boot, React, Python, and modern AI technologies. 
          I’m driven by how intelligent systems, automation, and good design can

        </p>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.8)" }}>
          Beyond coding, I love exploring UI/UX design, experimenting with new 
          ideas, and finding creative ways to merge technology with simplicity. 
          Whether it's building interactive interfaces, optimizing user experience, 
          or adding small creative touches — I enjoy making products that feel both 
          powerful and intuitive.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m a Computer Science graduate with hands-on experience in full-stack 
          development, cloud technologies, and AI-based projects. Skilled in 
          Java, Spring Boot, React, Node.js, Python, SQL, and Generative AI, I’m 
          always eager to learn and contribute to meaningful solutions. I’m currently
